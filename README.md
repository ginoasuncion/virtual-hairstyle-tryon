# Virtual Hairstyle Try-On with Barbershop Model

This repository contains code and resources for exploring the Barbershop model, which is designed for hairstyle transfer tasks. The Barbershop model was introduced by [Zhu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01505) in 2021 and utilizes StyleGAN2 for hairstyle transfer.

The Barbershop model has been tested on datasets featuring Thai actors/actresses and Thai friends from school as part of a school project in Harbour Space University.

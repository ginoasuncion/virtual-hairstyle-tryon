# Barbershop Model Exploration

This repository contains code and resources for exploring the Barbershop model, which is designed for hairstyle transfer tasks. The Barbershop model was introduced by Zhu et al. in 2021 and utilizes StyleGAN2 for hairstyle transfer.

Explore the provided notebooks and scripts to analyze the Barbershop model's performance and behavior.

## Contents
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the image dataset used to train the Barbershop model.
- `Model_Testing.ipynb`: Notebook for testing the Barbershop model on different datasets and analyzing its performance.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing scripts for specific tasks such as data preprocessing.

## Sample Results

The Barbershop model has been tested on datasets featuring Thai actors/actresses and Thai friends from school. Below are some sample results from the model exploration.
